# Pairip VM (CXX)

Inspired by the fundamentals, I decided to dive back into C++ and experiment with
template metaprogramming. As a result, I developed a C++ implementation that can
evaluate opcodes within a bytecode file, regardless of the underlying version of
the libpairipcode library.

In the following sections, the architecture and design decisions behind
the implementation are explained, along with a guide on how to use the
provided code.
